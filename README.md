## Chosen Project: Option 4

Data Display and Search
Create a catalogue (like encyclopedia) of data on adoptable pets (name, description, location, etc.) where one can browse and search the dataset. You can start with this dataset, modify it, or use another dataset with similar fields. 
1. **Example search queries you'll want to be able to handle: all dogs, by pet's name and female cats with tabby colouring**
2. **Add search autocomplete**
3. **Bonus points for making it responsive and work well on small screens (phone, tablets) and with touch interactions.**
4. **Extra bonus points if you add animal images to the catalogue.**

## Third party dependencies used for this application

* Picasso by Squareup: For image management
* ColourSlider by github.com/naz013: For colour selection
* Animal Icons by github.com/wayou
 
## Known bugs
* When adding a custom animal image, if the back button is pressed before the image is selected on the image selection dialog the app will crash
